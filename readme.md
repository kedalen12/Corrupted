    4.   Test Enemies
    Who will chase you into their field of vision, they also attack you if they are too close (keep calm that you will not die) and at a sufficient distance the player can mislead them

    5.  In the HUB we have 2 indicator bars.
        The first bar is the life of the player (decreases with the attacks of the enemies).
        The second bar is the player's energy (decreases when we cast spells, but recovers over time).
